    "## Grouping\n",
    "When working with collections of custom objects, you may often need to group them based on certain criteria. The GroupBy method in LINQ provides a convenient way to group elements of a collection based on a specified key.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the GroupBy method with custom classes, you need to define the key selector, which determines the grouping criterion. You can implement the IEqualityComparer<T> interface to provide custom equality comparison logic for grouping."
